# Pokemon CLI Tool
Yes, I'm sure there is probably already something out there that does that. And probably 100x better. The scope and purpose of this project really probably doesn't make sense and will likely change a bunch of different times. The main back story to the this project is to learn many different aspects and areas of the Go programming Language while taking notes along the way. I am in desperate need of use cases but always have a really hard time finding one so this is helping me focus on things from basic beginner best practices to advanced aspects such as Testing. This is and will be a continuous work in progress.

**NOTE**: No, I don't like Pokemon. I just really like the free API. I'm not against Pokemon by any means and I am sure I would actually like it if I played or watched it (my kids like it). I just never have.
